# NuzlockeTracker

An attempt at a Pokemon Nizlocke Tracker. 
The program allows you to choose which pokemon version you are playing and will serve as a tool to track which pokemon you captured for each location.
For this program I wanted to practice using Tkinter and Tkinter Canvas in an MVC program.

Currently supported games:
Red
Blue
Yellow
Gold
Silver
Crystal
Ruby
Sapphire
